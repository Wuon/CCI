# Patterns

## Sliding Window

Typically, this pattern can be identified when an index can move forwards or backwards
during iteration. This is useful because the size of the window can be fixed, grow or
shrink depending on the conditional logic.

A brute force approach on this type of problem would be to compute every possibility.

``` javascript
function max_sub_array_of_size_k(k, arr) {
  let maxSum = 0,
    windowSum = 0;

  for (i = 0; i < arr.length - k + 1; i++) {
    windowSum = 0;
    for (j = i; j < i + k; j++) {
      windowSum += arr[j];
    }
    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
  }
  return maxSum;
}


console.log(`Maximum sum of a subarray of size K: ${max_sub_array_of_size_k(3, [2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2])}`);
console.log(`Maximum sum of a subarray of size K: ${max_sub_array_of_size_k(2, [2, 3, 4, 1, 5])}`);
```

This poses a problem however, since the runtime is O(n * k). It is still possible to improve the
sliding window technique, by retaining previous information.

``` javascript
function max_sub_array_of_size_k(k, arr) {
  let maxSum = 0,
    windowSum = 0,
    windowStart = 0;

  for (window_end = 0; window_end < arr.length; window_end++) {
    windowSum += arr[window_end]; // add the next element
    // slide the window, we don't need to slide if we've not hit the required window size of 'k'
    if (window_end >= k - 1) {
      maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
      windowSum -= arr[windowStart]; // subtract the element going out
      windowStart += 1; // slide the window ahead
    }
  }
  return maxSum;
}


console.log(`Maximum sum of a subarray of size K: ${max_sub_array_of_size_k(3, [2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2])}`);
console.log(`Maximum sum of a subarray of size KL ${max_sub_array_of_size_k(2, [2, 3, 4, 1, 5])}`);
```

The new solution runs in O(n), by keeping all of the data inside of the window in memory, it is possible to
remove the last data point and insert the new data point for linear time.
